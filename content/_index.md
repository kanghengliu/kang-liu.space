Hello and welcome to my webspace!

This is a cozy little space I've created in the vast sea of the Net, in hopes of some peaceful writing/reading for myself;
I hope you, dear reader, can find even just a <small>teeny tiny</small> bit of comfort here as well!
<div class="centered">🍀 <small>This is here to push down the next div. Cat too big.</small></div>
