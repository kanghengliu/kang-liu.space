Hello and welcome to my webspace!

This is a cozy little space I've created in the vast sea of the Net, in hopes of some peaceful writing/reading for myself;
I hope you, dear reader, can find even just a <small>teeny tiny</small> bit of comfort here as well!

# About Me

My name is Kangheng Liu, or <mark>Kang</mark> for short. I'm a Data Science enthusiast, <abbr title="Original Soundtrack">OST</abbr> lover, Gamer/Modder, **terminal** Linux patient <span class="spoiler">get it? hahah</span> and want a cat ~~so bad that I just have to put a cute kitten up there.~~

Find out more about me in my portfolios that I will ~~surely~~ remember to update soon!
